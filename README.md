Local Motion Aware Transformer for Small Infrared Moving Target Detection

To enhance the detection of infrared moving small targets on dynamic platforms, we propose leveraging the localized motion features that differentiate the targets from their backgrounds, and fusing these features with the global contextual information extracted by a Transformer model. This integrated approach aims to improve the robustness and accuracy of detecting such challenging targets.
